# Simple-Calculator
This is a simple calculator project I have built in C++ as part of my Computer Science course.

It represents a simple use of if and while loops in order to achieve a simple and functional result. The main challenge at the time I found to be around the correct looping through the program, however, after figuring this out, everything else fell in place.

This has been a simple, yet effective opportunity to learn about the smart use of loops and the importance of those in the program flow.
